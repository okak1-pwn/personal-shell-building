A Python learning challenge to better understand Python libraries.

Logic.py: Logic behind handling executables 
Commands.py: specific command handling
Register.py: a scaling solution to store each command type and name.
main.py: logic behind the initialization of the console.

Local commands that are in your PATH env will run if you don't want this cleanse your path using export PATH="" in Linux and SET PATH= in windows
beware this can stop you from using relative names for commands.
For example to run python you would now need the absolute path
